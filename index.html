				I am an outgoing and energetic young professional seeking a career that fits my professional skills, 
				personality and stormy tendencies. I am renown for my teaching capabilities and my white hair 
				testifies of my weather controlling tendencies (my favourite being my namesake "Storms". I am 
				the perfect secret weapon; I inspire fear not on sight but when I choose to. I can achieve world 
				domination or devastation with just the flick of my little finger or the slight change of my emotions.
